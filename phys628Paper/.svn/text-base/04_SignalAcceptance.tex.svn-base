The overall signal selection efficiency 
is the product of efficiency and acceptance factors, \Cllll{} and \Allll{}, respectively.
The efficiency factor \Cllll{} is the ratio of
the number of \Zllll{} events passing the reconstructed event selections
to the number in the fiducial region,
and is determined using the signal MC samples after the detector simulation.
The fiducial region, defined at the MC generator level 
using the lepton four-momenta, requires
$p_\mathrm{T} > 20, 15, 10(8), 7(4)$~\GeV{} 
and $|\eta| < 2.5(2.7)$ of the $p_\mathrm{T}$-ordered $e(\mu)$,
$\Delta R(\ell, \ell') > 0.1(0.2)$ for all same(different)-flavor lepton pairs,
$m_{\ell^+\ell^-} > 20$~\GeV{} for at least one lepton pair,
$m_{\ell^+\ell^-} >  5$~\GeV{} for all same-flavor lepton pairs,
and $80 < m_{4\ell} < 100$~\GeV{}.
The four-momenta of all final state photons
within $\Delta R = 0.1$ of a lepton are summed into the four-momentum of that lepton.
The acceptance factor \Allll{} is the fraction
of \Zllll{} events in the final phase space 
which falls into the fiducial region.
The \Cllll{} uncertainty is mostly experimental
and the \Allll{} uncertainty is entirely theoretical.
The \Allll{} and \Cllll{} values
are listed in Table~\ref{tab:xsec} for each channel and dataset.
The \Cllll{} values for 8~\TeV{} are larger than for 7~\TeV{} due to a variety of factors,
including electron identification improvements with better bremsstrahlung treatment 
and additional muon detector coverage.

The MC lepton identification and trigger efficiencies are corrected based on studies performed in data control regions.
The energy and momentum scales and resolutions
of the MC events are calibrated to reproduce data
from $Z\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$ and $J/\psi \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$ decays.
The uncertainties on the \Zllll{} signal detection efficiency
are determined by varying the nominal calibrations
(including lepton energy and momentum resolutions and scales,
and the trigger, reconstruction and identification efficiencies)
in the MC samples by one standard deviation.
For the 8~\TeV{} (7~\TeV{}) analysis,
the relative uncertainties on the $C_{4\ell}$ factors are
\UCTotalMMEightTeVSummary{} (2.7\%),     
\UCTotalEMEightTeVSummary{} (4.9\%),
\UCTotalMEEightTeVSummary{} (9.8\%),
and \UCTotalEEEightTeVSummary{} (14.9\%)
for $\mu\mu+\mu\mu$, $ee+\mu\mu$, $\mu\mu+ee$, and $ee+ee$, respectively,
where the labeling $\ell\ell+\ell'\ell'$ indicates the leading and sub-leading lepton pairs.
The major uncertainty contributions come from the lepton reconstruction 
and identification efficiencies.

The relative uncertainties on the $A_{4\ell}$ factors, 
evaluated using \progname{Powheg} MC samples,
range from 1.3\% to 1.7\% depending on channel.
The theoretical uncertainties reflect uncertainties
from the choice of QCD scales and PDFs.
The scales are varied independently from 0.5 to 2.0 times 
the nominal $\mu_\mathrm{R}, \mu_\mathrm{F} = m_{4\ell}$.
The PDF uncertainties are estimated by 
taking the sum in quadrature of the deviations of $A_{4\ell}$ for each
PDF error set (52 CT10 eigenvectors varied by one standard deviation)
and for an alternative PDF set, MSTW2008~\cite{bib:MSTW2008},
with respect to the nominal one.
