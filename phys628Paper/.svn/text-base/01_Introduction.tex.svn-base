This Letter presents measurements of the \xsecs{} for the inclusive production
of four leptons (4$\ell$, $\ell = e, \ \mu$)   
at the $Z$ resonance in proton--proton collisions
at $\sqrt s$ = 7 and 8~\TeV{}
using data recorded by the ATLAS detector~\cite{bib:ATLASDetectorPaper}  
at the LHC~\cite{bib:LHCMachine} in 2011 and 2012.
In the Standard Model (SM), $4\ell$ production in the $Z$ resonance region occurs dominantly
via an \mbox{$s$-channel} diagram such as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:z4l_feynman}(a)
where the $Z$ boson decay to charged leptons includes the production of an additional lepton pair from
the internal conversion of a virtual $Z$ or $\gamma$.
A small fraction of 4$\ell$ events is also produced in a \mbox{$t$-channel} process
such as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:z4l_feynman}(b).
The process $gg\rightarrow Z^{(*)}Z^{(*)}\rightarrow 4\ell$
accounts for only about $10^{-3}$ of the total 4$\ell$ event rate
around the $Z$ resonance~\cite{Campbell:2011bn}.

A resonant peak around the $Z$ mass in the 4$\ell$ invariant mass
spectrum is observed along with the nearby peak from the Higgs boson
decay $H\rightarrow 4\ell$~\cite{Aad20121,Chatrchyan201230}.
A measurement of the 4$\ell$ production cross section at the $Z$ resonance 
provides a test of the SM
and a cross-check of the detector response to 
the 4$\ell$ final state from Higgs decays.

Since the interference between the 
resonant and non-resonant ($t$-channel and $gg$) production mechanisms
is expected to be very small around the $Z$ resonance,
the branching fraction of the rare decay $Z\rightarrow 4\ell$ can be determined
by subtracting the expected non-resonant 4$\ell$ contributions from the measured
4$\ell$ rate. 
For simplicity, inclusive 4$\ell$ production around the $Z$ resonance,
including the non-resonant contributions,
is denoted as $Z\rightarrow 4\ell$ from here on, 
except that the branching fraction $\ZllllFrac{}$ refers to the $s$-channel contribution alone.
The CMS Collaboration has observed the \SingleZllll{} resonance in $\sqrt{s}=7$~\TeV{} data
and determined a branching fraction, summed over the $4e$, $4\mu$ and $2e2\mu$ final states, of
$\ZllllFrac{} = \CMSObsBranching{}$,
where $80 < m_{4\ell} < 100$~\GeV{} and 
$m_{\ell\ell} > 4$~\GeV{} for all pairs of leptons  
(regardless of lepton flavor or charge)~\cite{Zto4lCMS}.
The results presented here include 
the first cross section measurement of the 4$\ell$ production at the $Z$ resonance 
at $\sqrt s$ = 8~\TeV{}, 
and a determination of $\ZllllFrac{}$ with improved statistical precision.

The inclusive 4$\ell$ production \xsec{} at the $Z$ resonance
is measured separately for the 4$e$, 4$\mu$ and 2$e$2$\mu$ final states
for each of the  $\sqrt s $ = 7 and 8~\TeV{} datasets
in a fiducial region (defined below) corresponding 
closely to the experimental acceptance.
The measured fiducial \xsecs{} are then extrapolated to 
a final phase-space region defined by the dilepton and four-lepton 
invariant mass requirements $m_{\ell^+\ell^-} > 5$~\GeV{} 
and $80 < m_{4\ell} < 100$~\GeV{},
where $\ell^+\ell^-$ denotes all same-flavor lepton pairs with opposite charge.
The branching fraction $\ZllllFrac{}$ is determined by normalizing the
resonant 4$\ell$ production rate to the
$Z \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ production rate measured in the same dataset.

The ATLAS detector
has a cylindrical geometry~\footnote{ATLAS uses
a right-handed coordinate system with its origin
at the nominal interaction point(IP) in the center of the detector,
and the $z$-axis along the beam line. The $x$-axis points from the IP to
the center of the LHC ring, and the $y$-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates
($r,\ \phi$) are used in the transverse plane, $\phi $ 
being the azimuthal angle around the beam line.
The pseudorapidity is defined
in terms of the polar angle $\theta $ as $\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)$.
Observables labeled ``transverse'' are projected into the $x$--$y$ plane.}
and consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a 2~T superconducting solenoid, 
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer with a toroidal magnetic field. 
The inner detector (ID) provides precision tracking for charged particles for $|\eta|<2.5$. 
It consists of silicon pixel and strip detectors surrounded by a straw tube tracker that 
also provides transition radiation measurements for electron identification. The calorimeter 
system covers the pseudorapidity range $|\eta|< 4.9$. 
For $|\eta|<2.5$, the liquid-argon 
electromagnetic calorimeter is finely segmented and plays an important role 
in electron identification.
The muon spectrometer includes fast-trigger chambers ($|\eta|<2.4$) 
and high-precision tracking chambers covering $|\eta|<2.7$.
