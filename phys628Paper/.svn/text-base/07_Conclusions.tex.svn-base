In summary, measurements of the \xsecs{} of 4$\ell$ production
at the $Z$~resonance in $pp$ collision
data collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC have been presented.
The datasets analyzed correspond to an integrated luminosity of
\LumiSevenTeV{} and \LumiEightTeV{} 
at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 and 8~\TeV{}, respectively.
The total \Zllll{} production \xsecs{}
in the phase-space region $m_{\ell^+\ell^-}>5$~\GeV{}
and $80 < m_{4\ell} < 100$~\GeV{}
are measured to be $\SigPS{}$ = 
$76\pm 18 \text { (stat) } \pm 4 \text { (syst) } \pm 1.4 \text { (lumi) }$ fb
at 7~\TeV{}
and 
$107\pm 9 \text{ (stat) } \pm 4 \text{ (syst) } \pm 3.0 \text { (lumi) }$ fb
at 8~\TeV{}, 
consistent with the SM predictions of 
\PhaseSpaceXsecTheorySevenTeV{} and \PhaseSpaceXsecTheoryEightTeV{}, respectively.
Normalizing to the measured $Z\rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ production,
the $Z \rightarrow 4\ell$ branching fraction  
is determined to be \ObsBranching{},
consistent with the SM prediction of \ExpectedBranching{}.
