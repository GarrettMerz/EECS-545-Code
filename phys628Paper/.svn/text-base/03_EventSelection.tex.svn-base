The \Zllll{} event selection closely follows the 
$H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 4\ell$ analysis~\cite{Aad2012-higgs}
with muon \pt{}
and dilepton invariant mass requirements loosened
to increase the acceptance for the \Zllll{} process.

Muons are identified by tracks (or track segments) reconstructed in the muon spectrometer
and are matched to tracks reconstructed in the ID.
The muon momentum is calculated by combining the information from the two subsystems,
correcting for the energy lost in the calorimeters.
Additionally, one muon in each event is allowed to be a 
stand-alone muon 
or a calorimeter-tagged muon, 
where the stand-alone muon is 
identified by only a muon spectrometer track in $2.5<|\eta|<2.7$,
and the calorimeter-tagged muon is identified by an ID track with \pt{} $>$ 15~\GeV{}
associated with a compatible calorimeter energy deposit in $|\eta|<0.1$.
All muon candidates are required to have \pt{} $>$ 4~\GeV{} and $|\eta|<2.7$.

Electrons are reconstructed from energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter
matched to a track in the ID~\cite{egammanote}.  
Tracks associated with electromagnetic clusters are fitted using a Gaussian Sum Filter~\cite{egammaGSF},
which allows bremsstrahlung energy losses to be taken into account.
For $\sqrt{s}=8$~\TeV{} data, improved 
electron discrimination from jets is obtained using a likelihood function formed from
parameters characterizing the shower shape and track association,
resulting in a reduction of the electron misidentification rate by more than a factor of two
compared to that at 7 TeV.
Electron candidates are required to have \pt{} $>$ 7~\GeV{} and $|\eta| < 2.47$.

Collision events are selected by requiring at least one reconstructed vertex
with at least three charged particle tracks with \pt{} $>$ 0.4~\GeV{}.
If more than one vertex satisfies the selection requirement,
the primary vertex is chosen as the one with the highest  $\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}^2$, 
summed over all tracks associated with the vertex.

In order to reject electrons and muons from jets, only isolated leptons are selected, requiring
the scalar sum of the transverse momenta, $\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}$, of other tracks inside a cone size of
$\Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^2 + (\Delta\phi)^2} = 0.2$ around the lepton to be less than 15\%
of the lepton \pt{}.
In addition, the $\sum \ET$ deposited in calorimeter cells inside a cone size of
$\Delta R = 0.2$ around the lepton direction, excluding the transverse energy due to the lepton and
corrected for the expected pile-up contribution, 
is required to be less than 30\% of the lepton \pt{}, reduced to
20\% for electrons in the 8~\TeV{} dataset and 15\% for stand-alone muons.
To further reject leptons from heavy-flavor jets,
the impact parameter relative to the primary vertex
is required to be less than
3.5 (6.0) standard deviations for all muons (electrons),
where the looser electron requirement allows for tails in the electron impact parameter distribution due to bremsstrahlung in the ID.

Candidate quadruplets are formed by
selecting two opposite-sign, same-flavor dilepton pairs in an event.
The four leptons of the quadruplets are required to be well separated,
$\Delta R >0.1$ for same-flavor lepton pairs and $\Delta R >0.2$ for $e \mu$ pairs.
The two leading leptons must have \pt{} $>$ 20~\GeV{} and \pt{} $>$ 15~\GeV{}.
The third lepton must have \pt{} $>$ 10 (8)~\GeV{} if it is an electron (muon).
The dilepton pair with greatest invariant mass (denoted $m_{12}$) is called the leading lepton pair,
while the sub-leading lepton pair is chosen to have the largest
invariant mass (denoted $m_{34}$) among the remaining possible pairs.
The dilepton masses must satisfy $m_{12} > 20$~\GeV{} and $m_{34} > 5$~\GeV{}.
In the $4e$ and $4\mu$ channels
all same-flavor, opposite-sign lepton pairs 
are required to have $m_{\ell^+\ell^-} > 5$~\GeV{}.
This helps to reject events containing $J/\psi\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$ decays.
The invariant mass
of the lepton quadruplet is restricted to $80 < m_{4\ell} < 100$~\GeV{}.
A total of \ObsAllSevenTeV{} and \ObsAllEightTeV{}
\Zllll{} candidate events are selected in the 7 and 8~\TeV{} datasets, respectively.
The distributions of $m_{12}$, $m_{34}$, and $m_{4\ell}$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:z4l_mass}.
The number of events observed in each channel is shown in Table~\ref{tab:xsec}.
The $2e2\mu$ channel is divided into $ee+ \mu\mu$ and $\mu\mu + ee$ channels
indicating the lepton flavors of the leading and sub-leading lepton pairs.
