The overall background 
in the selected 4$\ell$ event sample is estimated to be below 1\%,
as shown in Table~\ref{tab:xsec}.
The background contributions 
from diboson production are estimated, using MC simulations,
to be $0.06 \pm 0.01$ and $0.49 \pm 0.04$ events
in the 7 and 8~\TeV{} datasets, respectively.
Background contributions from $Z$+jets and top production processes
are estimated from data. 
Such background events
may contain two isolated leptons from $\Z$ decays or from $\W$ decays in top events,
together with additional activity such as heavy-flavor jets
or misidentified components of jets yielding reconstructed leptons.
These backgrounds are estimated from data using a background-enriched control 
sample of $\ell\ell j_\ell j_\ell$ events,
selected with the standard signal requirements
except that lepton-like jets, $j_\ell$, are selected in place of two of the signal leptons.
Electron-like jets, $j_e$,  in the $\ell\ell j_\ell j_\ell$ control sample 
are obtained from electromagnetic clusters matched
to tracks in the ID that do not satisfy the identification criteria or isolation requirements.
Muon-like jets, $j_\mu$, are defined as muon candidates that fail the requirements
on isolation.
The reducible background in the signal sample is estimated by scaling each event
in the $\ell\ell j_\ell j_\ell$ control sample by $f_1\times f_2$, 
where the factor 
$f_i$ ($i=1,2$)
for each of the two lepton-like jets
depends on lepton flavor and \pt{}.
The factor $f$ is the ratio of the probability for a jet to
satisfy the signal lepton selection criteria
to the probability for the jet to satisfy the lepton-like jet criteria,
and is obtained from independent jet-enriched 
data samples dominated by $Z$+jets or $t\bar t$ events.
The uncertainties on $f$ are determined from the variations of $f$ in data samples obtained
with alternative lepton-like jet selections and
different jet compositions.
The estimated background from $Z$+jets and top processes
ranges from 0.05 to 0.20 events for the different channels and datasets;
for all 4$\ell$ channels combined it is estimated 
to be \BkgATotalTotalSRSevenTeV{} and \BkgATotalTotalSREightTeV{} events
for the 7 and 8~\TeV{} data, respectively.
