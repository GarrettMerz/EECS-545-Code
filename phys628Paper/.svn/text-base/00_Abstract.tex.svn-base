Measurements of four-lepton (4$\ell$, $\ell=e,\mu$)
production \xsecs{}
at the $Z$~resonance in $pp$ collisions at the LHC 
with the ATLAS detector are presented.
For
dilepton and four-lepton invariant
mass region
$m_{\ell^+\ell^-} > 5$~\GeV{} 
and $80 < m_{4\ell} < 100$~\GeV{},
the measured \xsecs{} are
$76 \pm 18 \text { (stat) } \pm 4 \text { (syst) } \pm 1.4 \text { (lumi) }$ fb and
$107 \pm 9 \text{ (stat) } \pm 4 \text{ (syst) } \pm 3.0 \text { (lumi) }$ fb
at $\sqrt s$ = 7 and 8~\TeV{}, respectively.
By subtracting the non-resonant 4$\ell$ production contributions and normalizing with $Z\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ events, 
the branching fraction for the $Z$~boson decay to $4\ell$ is
determined to be \ObsBranching{},
consistent with the Standard Model prediction.
