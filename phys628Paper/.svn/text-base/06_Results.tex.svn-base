The numbers of signal events predicted by MC simulation are
\ExpectedSigAllSevenTeV{} and \ExpectedSigAllEightTeV{} for 7 and 8~\TeV{}, respectively.
The data and MC predictions, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:z4l_mass}, are in good agreement.
Denoting the integrated luminosity by $L$,
the measured fiducial \xsecs{} (\SigFid{}), determined by 
(\NObs{} - \NBkg{})/($ L \times C_{4\ell}$), 
are given in Table~\ref{tab:xsec}.

The cross section in the final phase space for each channel
is calculated by \SigFid{}/\Allll{}.
The cross sections obtained for the $ee+ee$ and $\mu\mu+\mu\mu$ channels, 
and for the $2e+2\mu$ and $2\mu+2e$ channels,
are compatible within errors and are combined
using $2\times 2$ covariance matrices.
The total inclusive 4$\ell$ \xsec{} is a sum of the two combined \xsecs{}, 
and the uncertainty includes  correlations between the four channels.
The \xsecs{} listed in Table~\ref{tab:xsec} 
are consistent with the SM predictions given earlier.

The \SingleZllll{} branching fraction, \ZllllFrac{},
is determined by subtracting the non-resonant contributions 
to the selected events and 
normalizing the resulting yield to
the observed number of $Z\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ events in the same dataset,
\[
  \ZllllFracDisp{}
     = \left(\ZmmFracDisp{}\right)
       \frac{\left(\NObs{} - \NBkg{}\right) \left(1-f_{\mathrm{nr}}\right) C_{2\mu} \cdot A_{2\mu}}{\left(\NObsMuMu{} - \NBkgMuMu{}\right) \Cllll{} \cdot \Allll{}}
       ,
\]
where $\ZmmFrac{} = \ZmumuBR{}$~\cite{PDG},
\NObsMuMu{} is around 1.7 million and 8.9 million
in the 7 and 8~\TeV{} datasets, respectively,
and \CAmumu{} is \AzmumuSevenTeV{} and \AzmumuEightTeV{},
respectively.
The background (\NBkgMuMu{}) is estimated to be around 0.3\% of the selected $Z\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ events,
where the multijet and $W+$jets contributions are 
obtained using a data-driven method similar to that used for the \Zllll{} background estimation,
and other background contributions are estimated with simulated MC samples.
The branching fraction for \SingleZllll{}, summed over all $\ell=e,\mu$ final states,
is determined with both the 7 and 8~\TeV{} datasets.
The measured branching fractions for each dataset are consistent within uncertainties and are combined, giving
\[
  \ZllllFrac{} = \ObsBranching{}
\]
in the final phase-space region,
where the systematic uncertainty includes a contribution (about $0.2\%$) due to 
the interference between the \mbox{$s$-channel} and \mbox{$t$-channel} processes, 
calculated using \progname{CalcHep}~\cite{CalcHEP}.
The measured branching fraction is consistent with the SM prediction of
\ExpectedBranching{},
calculated using \progname{Powheg}. 
For a larger final phase-space region defined by
$m_{\ell^+\ell^-} > 4$~\GeV{} and $80 < m_{4\ell} < 100$~\GeV{},
similar to that used by CMS, 
the acceptance factors $A_{4\ell}$ and the non-resonant fractions $f_{\mathrm{nr}}$,
and their uncertainties, are also evaluated (leaving the fiducial region unchanged),  
and
the measured branching fraction becomes
$\ZllllFrac{} = \AltObsBranching{}$, compared with
an SM prediction of \AltExpectedBranching{}.
This result is consistent
with the CMS result measured with data
collected from $pp$ collisions at 7 TeV.
