Measurements of four-lepton (4l, l=e, mu) production cross sections at the Z resonance in pp collisions at the LHC
with the ATLAS detector are presented. For dilepton and four-lepton invariant mass region m_ll > 5 GeV and 80 < m_4l < 100 GeV,
the measured cross sections are 76 +/- 18 (stat) +/- 4 (syst) +/- 1.4 (lumi) fb and
107 +/- 9 (stat) +/- 4 (syst) +/- 3.0 (lumi) fb at Ecm = 7 and 8 TeV, respectively.
By subtracting the non-resonant 4l production contributions and normalizing with Z->mu(+)mu(-) events,
the branching fraction for the Z boson decay to 4l is determined to be (3.20 +/- 0.25 (stat) +/- 0.13 (syst)) * 10^(-6),
consistent with the Standard Model prediction.
